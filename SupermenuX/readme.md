# History

Early builds was generic plain no mascots,was actually presented in school (9th grade) and yeah it was decent,i think i need to
readjust things,but holy shit did i pass that class,it had Next,Back and the volt,volt button is magic because the esp32 sends
the volt received into the actual monitor,crazy stuff

Current 1.0 removes the volt button,its going to be replaced with something newer,and the menu is better,the previous menu of the
first version looked like this

2.0 Boykisser Edition (AGCKisser),specific free DLC that adds gyroscope as the mouse,laser controls and some other things,not out because i dont have the
gyroscope module,the GY521 one,also i have plans to add bluetooth support just incase,a addon for generic edition will also be added to its finals.
as a memory where i made the first one.
